# Chicago-crimes-2018-analysis
Chicago Crime Data available from https://data.cityofchicago.org/PublicSafety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 provide reported incidents of crime that
occurred in the City of Chicago. These data are available from 2001 through the present. Here, I have analysed the data using shiny package from R where 
the user can filter and interact with data and draw insights.
